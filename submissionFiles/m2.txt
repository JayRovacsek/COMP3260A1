Bromeliads are a varied group of organisms adapted to a number of climates, foliage take different shapes from needle
thin to broad and flat, symmetric, altoir, regular, spiky and soft. The foliage which usually grows in a rosetteis the most widely
patterned and colored of any plant in the World. Leaf colors range from maroon through shades of green to gold varieties may have
leaves with red, yellow, white and cream variegations, others may be spotted with purple, red or cream, while others have different
colors on the tops and bottoms of the leaves. The plants within the Bromeliaceae are able to live in a vast array of environmental
conditions due to their many adaptations. Trichomes in the form of scales or hairs allow Bromeliads to capture water in cloud, forests
and help to reflect sunlight in desert environments. Some Bromeliads have also developed an adaptation known as the tank habit, which 
involves the Bromeliads forming at lightly bound structure with their leaves that helps to capture water and nutrients in the absence
of a well developed root system. Bromeliads also use crassulace, an acid metabolism photosynthesis to create sugars, this adaptation allows
Bromeliads in hotor dry climates to open their stomates at night, rather than during the day, which prevents them from losing water. Plants 
in the Bromeliaceae family are widely represented in their natural climates across the Americas, one species can be found in Africa. They
can be found at altitudes from sea level to four thousand two hundred meters, from rain forests to deserts. Only one Bromeliad, the pine apple 
is a commercially important food crop, many other Bromeliads are popular ornamental plants grown as both garden and house plants. There are 
also artificial Bromeliads which can be used as an alternative to there alones for purposes of decorating.

The Enigma machine was a cipher machine used to encrypt and decrypt secret
messages. More precisely, Enigma was a family of related electro-mechanical 
rotor machines comprising a variety of different models. The Enigma was used
commercially and was also adopted by the military and Governmental services 
of a number of nations most famously by Nazi Germany before and during Second 
World War. The German military model, the wehrmacht Enigma, is the version most
commonly discussed, the machine has gained notoriety because allied cryptologists
were able to decrypt a large number of messages that had been enciphered on the 
machine. Decryption was made possible by Polish cryptographers Marianre Jewskijerzyroycki and
Henry Kzygalski from cipher bureau reconstruction and decryption methods were delivered
from Poland to Britain and France. The intelligence gained through this source codenamed
Ultra was a significant aid to the allied war effort. The exact influence of Ultra is debated
but a typical assessment is that the end of the European war was hastened by two years
because of the decryption of German ciphers

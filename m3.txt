The purpose of cryptography is to transmit information in such a way 
that access to it is restricted entirely to the intended recipient,
even if the transmission itself is received by others. This science
is of increasing importance with the advent of broad cast and network
communication, such as electronic transactions, the internet email and
cellphones, where sensitive monetary business political and personal
communications are transmitted over public channels. Cryptography operates
by a sender scrambling or encrypting the original message or plaintext
in a systematic way that obscures its meaning. The encrypted message or cryptotext
is transmitted and the receiver recovers the message by unscrambling or
decrypting the transmission. Originally the security of a cryptogram
depended on the secrecy of the entire encrypting and decrypting
procedures. Today, however we use ciphers in which the algorithm for
encrypting and decrypting could be revealed to anybody without compromising
the security of a particular message, in such ciphers a set of specific parameters
called a key is used together with the plain text as an input to the encrypting
algorithm and together with the cryptotext as an input to the decrypting algorithm,
the encrypting and decrypting algorithms are publicly announced. The security of
the cryptogram depends entirely on the secrecy of the key to prevent this
being discovered by accident or systematic search, the key is chosen
as a very large number, once the key is established subsequent secure communication
can take place by sending cryptotext even over a public channel that is vulnerable
to total passive eavesdropping such as public announcements in mass media.
However to establish the key two users who may not be in contact or share any
secret information initially will have to discuss it using some other
reliable and secure channel. But since interception is a set of measurements 
performed by an eavesdropper on a channel, however difficult this might be from a
technological point of view, any classical key distribution can in principle be 
passively monitored without the legitimate users realizing that any eavesdropping 
has taken place.
